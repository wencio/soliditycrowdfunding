# soliditycrowdfunding
Here's a sample Solidity code for a simple crowdfunding contract:
This contract sets up a crowdfunding campaign with a specified goal and accepts contributions from anyone. The contribute function allows users to make a payment to the contract, and the checkGoalReached function allows users to check if the funding goal has been reached. If the goal is not reached, the refund function allows the creator of the campaign to refund the contributions to the backers.
